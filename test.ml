      "[The panic of 1901](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901) was \
       caused by a standoff between J.P. Morgan/James Hill and E. H. Harriman \
       for control over Northern Pacific Railways. Trying to take control of \
       the company, both parties combined bought over 94% of the float. At the \
       same time, other investors were heavily shorting the stock (to sell to \
       one of the parties), until at one point everyone realized that they \
       won't be able to cover their short position because Morgan/Hill and \
       Harriman won't sell their shares. The shorts were squeezed as they \
       fought for the remaining 6% of the shares and drove NP from $20 to \
       $240. To pay for the high covering share prices, the shorts liquidated \
       their other positions, causing mass panic that rippled through the \
       whole stock market. Overwhelming cries of \"sell! sell! sell!\" were \
       heard at the NYSE trading floor. Temporary relief were provided when \
       rumors of Morgan's broker's death were spread, but quickly dissipated \
       and the panic resumed. The whole ordeal concluded only when the two \
       parties reached a truce and the shorts were finally able to cover their \
       positions.";

      "What's going on gamblers? Well looks like we're back to discussing \
       value stocks with solid fundamentals that are undervalued and being hit \
       hard by shorts. Similar to the original GME in it's inception but \
       obviously different in it's own right.\n\n\
       Disclosure: This is not meant to be another \"short attack\" stock \
       conversation, but it turns out it's looking like UWMC is currently \
       being heavily shorted against, which is just a positive for those of us \
       who invested in the stock and know it's fair value, market share, and \
       future growth.\n\n\
       Before I jump into some information regarding UWMC, the short volumes, \
       and a few other things. For those who are new to this ticker and want \
       DD on it, click \
       [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5yvwc/uwmc_key_points_to_the_company/) \
       for my DD, it's pretty short and sweet.\n\n\
       Now, something that got everyone riled up over the last few days was \
       the fact that UWMC wasn't added to the Russell 1000 &amp; 3000 as \
       stated by FTSE Russell Preliminary Inclusions. Turns out for some \
       reason UWMC wasn't selected, and as the Russell Index were the one's \
       who mentioned that they were adding UWMC, CEO Matt Ishbia made a \
       statement to shareholders informing they didn't understand why it \
       wasn't added and believe that the Russell Index miscalculated the \
       available shares to the public (%5 minimum) and have sought out to \
       rectify this with the Russell Index. There's information on WSB  \
       regarding that so I won't go into details. But in short, there's a \
       chance still for UWMC to be added to the Russell Index and for it to be \
       corrected. Regardless if they're not added right away, we can \
       confidently expect them to at some point be added in the next future \
       quarters. CEO Matt Ishbia informed they've reached out to Russell Index \
       to try and have it rectified. Something that's important to understand \
       here is that UWMC being added to the Russell Index wasn't a major \
       factor for investors wanting to invest in this company. Being added to \
       the Russell Index, albeit would have been a great catalyst is not a \
       reason to be concerned, end of story. If you would like to have a quick \
       break down on some key points on the company, please click the link \
       above to my DD, it's pretty short and sweet.\n\n\
       Now, assuming you read my DD or already understand the value of this \
       company, the fact that it's severely undervalued, high dividends, %545 \
       growth year over year, etc etc. Something of notable mention here is \
       the current short volume percentage.\n\n\
       Before I jump into the details, there was a good post on here about \
       Finra and Fintel not reporting all of the short volume information and \
       not being able to provide the total amount of shares shorted from all \
       markets etc. This is very accurate as even on there websites, they \
       indicate that the information are from data pools that they have access \
       to and don't factor all shares, dark pools, etc. (To better understand; \
       to get the true volume of shorted stocks or short interest, you would \
       need to compile all trades from a variety of exchanges, NYSE, NASDAQ, \
       MM, etc.) Another thing I'd like to point out is that over the last \
       month or two, the short interest updates which are supposed to be \
       bi-weekly, has been reporting late. As of right now, we're 03/25/2021 \
       the available short interest data is currently dated as of 02/26/2021 \
       and that information was only updated last week from the previous date \
       of 02/12/2021 ... We're 03/25/2021 and the data is a whole month old \
       when it's supposed to be updated bi-weekly. I find that very odd, \
       unless I'm mistaken here, it seems there's a massive delay on updating \
       the Short Interests information on stocks. (Correct me if I'm wrong).\n\n\
       With that being said, I want to jump into the current short volume % as \
       per Fintel and ShortVolumes. This is not considered the true short \
       volume as it doesn't consider the entire market, but is used to probe \
       the current situation to get a better understanding as to how much of \
       the traded volume has been shorted and for the month of March, it's \
       incredibly high.\n\n\
       Most notable date is March 3rd, 2021 (Where it began), there was a \
       trading volume above 90M that day with 28% of the volume shorted. The \
       average volume traded daily is between 9M - 10M. That alone is massive. \
       Moving forward from the date of 03/03/2021, the short volume of the \
       daily trading volume has been averaging out to around 28-31%.\n\n\
       As of 03/11/2021 to present day; the average shorted volume has been \
       between 55% - 65%, which is absolutely ridiculous. Don't forget there's \
       only 90.23M float of shares available to the public. The rest is owned \
       by UWMC and Institutions and are not available to investors. Please \
       refer to the charts below.\n\n\
       &amp;#x200B;\n\n\
       https://preview.redd.it/du8ri17h84p61.png?width=842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ae417df7a25e14ca0a4095b98a86f0cc4e90c95\n\n\
       https://preview.redd.it/i8lyjf3i84p61.png?width=844&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1561154897a405d1d891e4c855626d4af818518\n\n\
       &amp;#x200B;\n\n\
       As you can see by the information above, UWMC is in fact being heavily \
       shorted against. The red bars on the chart is the shorted volume, green \
       is the long volume.\n\n\
       On top of that, don't forget the high %4.83 dividend payout dated \
       03/09/2021 that's going to be paid out to investors in April, which the \
       shorts must cover as well.\n\n\
       Another thing to factor in here is as of March the 3rd, 2021 and \
       onward, the average price of the stock has been between $8 and above. \
       This means that shorts most likely did not make any profits yet apart \
       from maybe the few who sold when it was starting to hit $9. (AKA \
       possibilities for a short squeeze and/or gamma squeeze is looking very \
       plausible).\n\n\
       Overall, UWMC is a serious company with 34% market share, the largest \
       wholesale lender in America, they're extremely undervalued, payout high \
       dividends, and the icing on the cake; they're extremely shorted for \
       reasons that make absolutely no sense. This is most definitely the \
       play, and a great hedge for the current market we're in, personal \
       opinion.\n\n\
       Disclaimer: I am invested in UWMC with 211 shares @ $9.09 and will be \
       buying more. Proof of positions are on my DD which is linked above.\n\n\
       I'm not a financial advisors, this is not financial advice, etc. etc.\n\n\
       I can write more about the positive sentiments UWMC has going for it \
       but it's currently 2:34 AM and I need to go to sleep and get ready for \
       work.\n\n\
       I hope this provides useful and to all investors print those tendies \
       and get that ticket to the moon one way or another! ðŸš€ðŸŒ”";
