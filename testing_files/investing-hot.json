of **ViacomCBS**, **Discovery** and **Baidu** as they were being sold off in massive blocks during the collapse of Bill Hwang\u2019s Archegos Capital Management.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Soros Fund Management bought $194 million of **ViacomCBS Inc.**, **Baidu Inc.** stock valued at $77 million, as well $46 million of **Vipshop Holdings Ltd.** and $34 million of **Tencent Music Entertainment Group** during the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing released Friday. A person familiar with the fund\u2019s trading said the company didn\u2019t hold the shares prior to Archegos\u2019s implosion.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Soros also increased its bet on **Amazon.com Inc.** and homebuilder **DR Horton Inc.**, which is now its second-largest public equity position.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The 13F, which money managers overseeing more than $100 million in U.S. equities must file quarterly, revealed that Soros held $4.5 billion of U.S. equities, down $77 million from the prior quarter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The biggest exit in the quarter was **Palantir Technologies Inc.** Soros sold 18.5 million shares valued at about $435 million.

That company is AT&amp;T (T) and we\u2019ll break-down some opportunities &amp; challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.\n\n**The Overview**\n\nAT&amp;T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&amp;T\u2019s communications segment contributes \\~79% of operating revenues and \\~80% of profits. AT&amp;T\u2019s recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&amp;T\u2019s development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&amp;T\u2019s revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.\n\nIn this day and age huge \u201cvalue\u201d is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&amp;T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.\n\n**HBO Max**\n\nOne of AT&amp;T\u2019s biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service\u2019s subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently **increased expectations** of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here\u2019s a look from their recent earnings presentation  \n\nAT&amp;T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \\~800k lines and an additional **\\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nWhen we look at AT&amp;T\u2019s share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn\u2019t necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&amp;T would be a better investment than a \u201cmore secure\u201d bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&amp;T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.\n\nA 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \\~6-7%, allows AT&amp;T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&amp;T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&amp;T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor\u2019s portfolio.\n\n**Positions Disclosure:** It can be assumed the author of this article has a long position in the stock.", "author_fullname": "t2_birw2fp4", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "The Weekly DD - AT&amp;T (T): A Bond Proxy", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/investing", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ndmymd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 55, "total_awards_received": 1, "media_embed": {}, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 55, "approved_by": null, "author_premium": true, "thumbnail": "", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1621195672.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.investing", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if I told you there was a stock that offers a ~6-7% dividend AND has potential for revenue growth, is that something you would be interested in?

May 17th is the deadline to report Q1&amp;#39;21 long positions. Some funds have already filled theirs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s Pabrai: &lt;a href=\"https://whalewisdom.com/filer/dalal-street-llc\"&gt;https://whalewisdom.com/filer/dalal-street-llc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s Munger: &lt;a href=\"https://whalewisdom.com/filer/daily-journal-corp\"&gt;https://whalewisdom.com/filer/daily-journal-corp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that they&amp;#39;re both self-described value investors, which means that they spend a lot of time studying the &amp;quot;margin of safety&amp;quot;. It allows them to take really concentrated positions in their highest conviction stocks than most other investors. They know they&amp;#39;re not going to lose money on a 3 year + timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charlie Munger has 5 long positions, Mohnish Pabrai has just 3. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are on record for saying that value investing no longer works in the US, but fishing in other parts of the world is easier. Non-value investors seem to agree as well. Cathie Wood is buying JD, Soros is buying BIDU.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both Munger and Pabrai added just ONE stock in Q&amp;#39;1, the same stock. I think its a &amp;quot;wonderful stock at a fair price&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Valuation looks good: &lt;a href=\"https://ibb.co/PNJ0yct\"&gt;https://ibb.co/PNJ0yct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EPS growth projections look good too: &lt;a href=\"https://ibb.co/9NvMmqR\"&gt;https://ibb.co/9NvMmqR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally it&amp;#39;s hard to guess their cost basis given that 13-Fs contain delayed data. In this case, we know for SURE that the best they could buy at was $220.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I excitedly bought my first lot yesterday at $209 after hours and I intend to DCA more over the next few months. MSCI China just entered bear territory, it&amp;#39;s possible that we&amp;#39;re near a floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know much about business in China. I have no interest in building DCF models. I gave a cursory glance to the SEC filings and earnings transcripts, but given that BABA is an ADR and China disallows foreign auditors, I don&amp;#39;t know how much to read into the numbers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure - I won&amp;#39;t be able to slice and dice all this data better than the most respected value investors in the world, working only part time and weekends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can copy them, and fate has given me an opportunity to outdo them on price!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking out for Burry and Buffett&amp;#39;s 13-Fs to hit EDGAR. If one of them has bought $BABA, I&amp;#39;m buying more stock. If both have, I&amp;#39;m going apeshit on leaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 1 - If your best bearish argument is \u201cCCP\u201d, that validates the strength of long thesis&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2 -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclosures: Not financial advice.

Excluding SBC Operating Expenses are at 26% YoY \n* No Debt on Balance Sheet \n\n**Summary of The Trade Desk**\n\n*The Trade Desk Inc is a global technology company that markets a software platform used by digital ad buyers to purchase data-driven digital advertising campaigns across various ad formats and devices.*\n\n\n**What I learned from Q1 call** \n\n**Three Big Drivers for the future** \n\n* CTV \n* UID 2.0 \n* Solimar Platform \n\n**So why do they matter?** \n\n**CTV** \n- CTV is an umbrella term, compromises of both Internet T.V and smart T.Vs.\n- More consumers switching from Cable to CTV \n- Major content owners moving more premium content online \n- T.V providers continue to fight for consumer attention \n\n**Current Problem**\n- Advertisers currently are paying premium prices to publishers (Websites like ESPN) without getting the value of said premium price. \n- The Trade Desk would allow them to not only receive that value but advertisers would now have the ability to be more deliberate about what CTV ads they buy and how to apply data driven decisioning in T.V at an increased scale.\n\n\n**UID 2.0** \n- This in TTD's eyes is the future of the internet in a world without cookies. This would essentially replace them. \n- I will do my best to explain said function, but to understand why does this need to be a thing and what is it solving? \n\n**Current Problem** \n- What the TTD is trying to accomplish is to create a free and open internet, an internet that can move past the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, Apple Ect. In fact the CEO Jeff Green uses the following sentence. \"Is the internet going to be controlled by large tech companies or will power be distributed. Will choice sit with consumers and each content owner?\"\n\n- We've heard of google and apple ending third party cookies in an attempt to \"protect\" their customers, which is true to an extent. \n\n**What UID 2.0 going to do to change the internet** \n- UID 2.0 is Open Source meanings you are able to build on it, and it is about a better internet allowing consumers to have control.\n \n**How it Works** \n\n**1)** Consumers sign in once with an email (this email is your *common ID*)\n**2)**  You will opt in site by site, app channel only once\n**3)** When you log in once, you will receive an email authentication providing consumers with the explanation of the value exchange of the internet. The idea is to make it clear and consistent. \n**4)** This common ID will be used by advertisers and publishers \n**5)** Consumers are then able to use privacy settings to change or opt out directly from the services they know. \n**6)** The consumer controls their data, it's not controlled by Big Tech. \n\n**But its Big Tech, how can they penetrate those \"Walled Gardens\"?** \n\n- *Double Encryption Publishers (DEP)*\n- This allows publishers to encrypt UID 2 and allows them to unencrypt it for certain advertisers or publishers. DEP prevents others from taking data and insight from publishers. (Yes even Big Tech) \n\n**Solimar** \n\n- Solimar is the TTD's biggest platform upgrade in their history (Well that's what Jeff said)\n- It is bringing together current existing features TTD offers and is making it easy to use for marketers \n- **Koa AI** for example is a current feature the is being upgraded and integrated into Solimar \n\n**Koa AI** \n- Koa AI is well... AI. It analyzes data from across the internet to help make sure you\u2019re reaching the right audience at the right price. As Koa learns, it optimizes your campaigns automatically.\n\n- \"Solimar helps advertisers want to understand how their campaigns are driving in-store sales. Building that off-site data into Solimar, whether it's retail stores or auto dealerships or ticket sales or any other form of business performance data, so the advertising campaign can seamlessly optimize for those business goals.\" - Jeff Green\n\n- He explains it better than I could\n \n- Solimar helps solve the problem of media marketers who have big plates to fill and who are running massive campaigns. \n- Solimar liberates the media trader to focus on campaign performance rather than having to turn the dials on every aspect of campaign management\n\n\n**What to gather your own opinions?** \n\n*https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/the-trade-desk-ttd-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/ar-BB1gAJwf \n*https://investors.thetradedesk.com/news-releases/news-release-details/trade-desk-reports-first-quarter-financial-results-4\n\n\n**TDLR** \n\n**Big Three Drivers for the Year**\n\n*CTV\n*UID 2.0\n*Solimar Platform\n\n\n\nWould love to hear opinions about TTD, discussing what the future looks like right now.

This is gonna be a long wall of text, I will write a tl;dr as well so please check the bottom if it scares you.\n\n**Why TKC?**\n\nSo I have been researching about Turkcell, a Turkish company that is traded in BIST (Istanbul stock exchange) and NYSE. It had my attention because its been under performing compared to both global stocks and Turkish stocks (even though it's been performing really well financially compared to other companies traded in BIST). Before dipping to $4.67 USD due to pandemic in late march - early april, it was traded for $5.77 USD (early march 2020) and it was around 10-11 USD during 2018. As of today, it's traded for only $4.56 USD. Biggest reason for that freefall of the stock price is downfall of the Turkish economy and the devaluation of the Turkish lira but other Turkish stocks doesn't seem to care as much as TKC does. For comparison, march 2020 dip of XU100 (adjusted by the USD exchange rate of that time) index was 114 (857/7,5), now it is 171 (1441/8.4). There has been a Turkish stock exchange rally even in USD terms as well, which TKC missed. Not to mention that Turkish banks performed terribly and they have around 17% [weight in the XU100.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqbtfSZXUAEnwu0?format=png&amp;name=small)\n\n**About the company**\n\nSo the company is primarily a telecommunication company (like Vodafone). Even though it offers value added services like BiP (mainly whatsapp alternative), Fizy (spotify alternative, TV+, Paycell (fintech), Pasaj (e-commerce mostly selling tech products), Lifebox (cloud service), Yaani (search engine), Dergilik (digital publishing platform) it's primary source of income is telecommunication and internet for home via Superonline (Turkcell company). The company operates in Turkey, Ukraine (lifecell), Belarus, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Netherlands and Germany (though their operations in the last 2 are not directly profit seeking afaik). Main competitors in Turkey (main market) are Vodafone and Turk Telekom. Vodafone and Turk Telekom offers cheaper prices but Turkcell offers better service and as of today it has the highest share of the market with 42%. Turkcell also invests more than the combination of the competition, [you can check their mobile data segment investments here](https://hwp.com.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mobile-yatirim.jpg). One last fundamental thing about company's operations is that it is part of the [TOGG project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOGG) (electric car company founded recently and according to their CEO, they will start the mass production is 2022) and owns 19% of the TOGG as well. The taxes for foreign made cars in Turkey are extremely high and the rumor is that the government is thinking about subsidizing this project to decrease country's account deficit by both not depending on foreign made cars and oil (which Turkey doesn't have).\n\n**Financials**\n\nI don't want to rewrite what is already written in detail so I will provide some sources instead.\n\n[1st Q 2021 presentation (1.1B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Presentation-Q121-ENG.pdf)\n\n[Annual report of 2020 (4.24B TL net income)](https://s.turkcell.com.tr/hakkimizda/en/yatirimciiliskileri/InvestorReportLibrary/Turkell-IAR-2020-ENG.pdf)\n\nTheir net income kept growing for a while, you can check more about their financials [in their website here.](https://www.turkcell.com.tr/en/aboutus/investor-relations) Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yIDdTqig4k) as well.\n\n**Possible things that may drive the value up.**\n\nI already talked about the TOGG project above, but the investors seem to didn't care about it. I think they have their doubts about the project (which is understandable due to fragile Turkish economy). But I believe if the mass production starts in 2022 it will have a really good impact on the stock.\n\nAnother thing is possible IPOs. In february this year, CEO stated that they are considering the IPO of their home internet company, Superonline. According to bloomberg, they started talking with the investment banks about it in April. You can read more about it [here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/turkcell-is-said-to-approach-banks-on-ipo-plan-for-internet-unit) Also, they were considering the [IPO of Global Tower in 2016](https://www.reuters.com/article/turkcell-globaltower-idUSL8N1CU4JX) but they didn't do it calling the market unsuitable for a new IPO. Considering the IPO madness happening in Turkish market, they may also consider it. I also want to remind you that vodafone did a similar IPO last year and they had a pretty good valuation.\n\nLastly, the stock had management issues before. The company couldn't share dividends and it had decision making issues as well. But as of June 2020, this problem is solved because Turkish Wealth Fund bought the stocks from Telia and Karamehmets. Now the company gives dividends quarterly (0.39 TRY per quarter and the stock is valued 15.20 TRY atm in Turkey, not sure about it in NYSE). I believe investing in TKC just because of the dividend is an enough reason.\n\n**One important thing that caught my eye**\n\nLast month one of the foreign institutions sent the [mandatory notification](https://www.kap.org.tr/en/Bildirim/932236) that their shares passed the 5% barrier. I was watching their aggressive purchases and they keep buying. [This is the buyers-sellers chart for the last one and a half month](https://imgur.com/a/juARwKD). Gedik investment made the 77% of the purchases. Gedik then transferred it to Deutsche bank. During that period amount of shares which are **held by the foreigners increased by 30 million stocks.**\n\n**Why you should NOT buy/why is it undervalued?**\n\nAs I mentioned above, TRY is not performing well. Lately, Turkish Lira lost good portion of it's value. This is the main risk for this stock in my opinion. But the thing is, **82% percent of the float is held by the foreigners**, and even though the foreigner's interest in Turkish stock exchange kept decreasing, their shares in Turkcell kept increasing. It seems they think that it is a good buy despite the risk of Turkish Lira. I also believe that it is a buy for sure long term, but it is risky for the short term. Also, even if the TRY performs well, there is a possibility that with the possible interest rates increase, **DXY may start it's bull run which will negatively affect the stock.**\n\nAnother thing is, in October, Letterone will have the ability to sell some of their shares in the stock exchange. It is not clear whether they will or not, but it is risky since it will increase the shares traded. Last year, they sold some of it on the market for 15.5 liras per share (15.20 is the current price of the stock).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary**\n\nI believe that this stock is a good buy because of their financials, dividend, investments (mainly the electric car project TOGG), incoming IPO and accumulation of the stocks by certain investment group. But there are 2 main risks as well, fragile Turkish economy and the stocks held by Letterone.

I am not very familiar with its methodology, but I did some reading and encountered the opinion its outperformance may not last due to a potential rise of interest rates. So I looked at a couple of other metrics--please keep in mind I don't know much about the bond market overall and would be happy to learn I have examined things incorrectly. \n\nI chose 2016 because it captured when the Federal Fund Rate started to meaningfully rise (they also started to rise in 2015, but I chose a nice 5 year slice). They increased steadily into 2019, then plateaued a bit, then of course were struck down by covid.\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)\n\nNext I looked into the daily treasury yield curve rates from this period. The 10 Year rate fluctuated steadily all throughout 2016 but ultimately ended the year higher. It fluctuated similarly through 2017, ending very slightly lower. It increased during most of 2018, then only ended slightly higher by the end of the year. It lowered through the end of 2019.  It ended much lower by 2020. And through today it is higher than in 2020, but still much lower than it has been in years. \n\n[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2016](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2016)\n\nBelow is a plot of the dividends paid from PSLDX, where all the gains are to be had.\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history)\n\nYou'll notice the higher dividend payouts tend to correspond to where the higher interest rates are plotted. Granted, the fund holds the S&amp;P, so its outperformance can in part be explained by the general rise of the S&amp;P 500 equities since 2016. But, I did not find where higher interest rates pose a risk to its performance. I also noticed its highest-ever dividend payout was in 2013, where the federal funds rate was miniscule and the 10 Year increased from 1.86 to 3.04 by the end of the year. And even when interest rates are very low, say from 2020-2021, the fund still outperforms the S&amp;P ETF listed, much less our favorite REIT. O, I can forgive, since I believe in its long term success. \n\n[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)\n\nIt appears the fund generates a great deal of alpha the higher interest rates become. It also generates alpha when interest rates are low. Drawdowns can indeed be high, so if one were to invest in the fund, it is likely best to put money into it after it has experienced a drawdown, or simply do what investors should do and put money into it that you don't plan on using for many years. \n\nThe share price is low--this is common with many mutual funds. Someone recently mentioned that as a drawback to it... yes, it is lower than the 10 dollar price in 2007... but I think if you understand this is a particular sort of fund and not some silly low budget penny stock, the difference is clear. It is a volatile fund, yet appears to have an overall stability over time, with extreme dividend payouts. While I think broad market ETFs are great for capturing the mood of the overall corporate economy, the more I read about this particular fund, the more I find it to be a good choice for outperformance over a multi-year period. People worry about so many things: expense ratios, volatility, weird methodology. Yet, total returns tend to present their own strong argument for an investment. \n\nIt appears to benefit from higher interest rates, and also does fine with lower interest rates. That is what I find to be especially interesting (ha). It's not a 3x leveraged daily fund subject to decay or anything like that, to my knowledge. It may even be simpler than your average PIMCO CEF.  \n\nI plan on trying to learn more about the fund before I actually put money into it, since I want a firmer grasp of its mechanics and especially want to determine if it can maintain its performance over more time. In the meantime, I think it's overlooked by everyone but niche investors. Plenty of garbage tickers are passed around on Reddit (hello bizarre mortgage REITs that obviously destroy value over time and fraudulent SPACs) but there is little popular information on this fund which is still kicking out solid performance since the Great Recession when derivatives really were the devil. \n\nAnyway when I post on Reddit, I do so to learn.

I am not very familiar with its methodology, but I did some reading and encountered the opinion its outperformance may not last due to a potential rise of interest rates. So I looked at a couple of other metrics--please keep in mind I don&amp;#39;t know much about the bond market overall and would be happy to learn I have examined things incorrectly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I chose 2016 because it captured when the Federal Fund Rate started to meaningfully rise (they also started to rise in 2015, but I chose a nice 5 year slice). They increased steadily into 2019, then plateaued a bit, then of course were struck down by covid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart\"&gt;https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next I looked into the daily treasury yield curve rates from this period. The 10 Year rate fluctuated steadily all throughout 2016 but ultimately ended the year higher. It fluctuated similarly through 2017, ending very slightly lower. It increased during most of 2018, then only ended slightly higher by the end of the year. It lowered through the end of 2019.  It ended much lower by 2020. And through today it is higher than in 2020, but still much lower than it has been in years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;amp;year=2016\"&gt;https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;amp;year=2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below is a plot of the dividends paid from PSLDX, where all the gains are to be had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history\"&gt;https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSLDX/dividends/history&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll notice the higher dividend payouts tend to correspond to where the higher interest rates are plotted. Granted, the fund holds the S&amp;amp;P, so its outperformance can in part be explained by the general rise of the S&amp;amp;P 500 equities since 2016. But, I did not find where higher interest rates pose a risk to its performance. I also noticed its highest-ever dividend payout was in 2013, where the federal funds rate was miniscule and the 10 Year increased from 1.86 to 3.04 by the end of the year. And even when interest rates are very low, say from 2020-2021, the fund still outperforms the S&amp;amp;P ETF listed, much less our favorite REIT. O, I can forgive, since I believe in its long term success. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults\"&gt;https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It appears the fund generates a great deal of alpha the higher interest rates become. It also generates alpha when interest rates are low. Drawdowns can indeed be high, so if one were to invest in the fund, it is likely best to put money into it after it has experienced a drawdown, or simply do what investors should do and put money into it that you don&amp;#39;t plan on using for many years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The share price is low--this is common with many mutual funds. Someone recently mentioned that as a drawback to it... yes, it is lower than the 10 dollar price in 2007... but I think if you understand this is a particular sort of fund and not some silly low budget penny stock, the difference is clear. It is a volatile fund, yet appears to have an overall stability over time, with extreme dividend payouts. While I think broad market ETFs are great for capturing the mood of the overall corporate economy, the more I read about this particular fund, the more I find it to be a good choice for outperformance over a multi-year period. People worry about so many things: expense ratios, volatility, weird methodology. Yet, total returns tend to present their own strong argument for an investment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It appears to benefit from higher interest rates, and also does fine with lower interest rates. That is what I find to be especially interesting (ha). It&amp;#39;s not a 3x leveraged daily fund subject to decay or anything like that, to my knowledge. It may even be simpler than your average PIMCO CEF.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I plan on trying to learn more about the fund before I actually put money into it, since I want a firmer grasp of its mechanics and especially want to determine if it can maintain its performance over more time. In the meantime, I think it&amp;#39;s overlooked by everyone but niche investors. Plenty of garbage tickers are passed around on Reddit (hello bizarre mortgage REITs that obviously destroy value over time and fraudulent SPACs) but there is little popular information on this fund which is still kicking out solid performance since the Great Recession when derivatives really were the devil. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway when I post on Reddit, I do so to learn. I very recently posted about the fund here--this was before I looked at interest rates and how they may correlate with it. I am becoming more convinced it is a good investment and would like to know arguments against it beyond the fact it&amp;#39;s more complex than a simple passive ETF.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": true, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq", "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "ndi9uf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ThemChecks", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/investing/comments/ndi9uf/sp_500_realty_income_and_sp_500_long_duration/", "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ndi9uf/sp_500_realty_income_and_sp_500_long_duration/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1837153, "created_utc": 1621146822.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "investing", "selftext": "So I came across a posting that has the top 100 ETF's with high returns over 5 years. many being quoted over 100%.  but if you look at the same stocks on other sites such as [ETF.com](https://ETF.com), they only quote 2 digit returns at best.   \n\n\n [ARKW](https://etfdb.com/etf/ARKW/) for example on [etfdb.com](https://etfdb.com) is showing a 615% return, but [ETF.com](https://ETF.com) is only 49%.   \n\n\nAny ideas of why such a big difference?   \n\n\nI'm wondering if perhaps they are using a compound, vs simple return as described in this article::   \n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/08/annualized-returns.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/08/annualized-returns.asp)  \n\n\nIf so, which method would be best to estimate expected returns, and do these numbers  include dividends you may get?  \n\n\nSide note, is there a number  to look at or way to calculate a value that best describes how often a ETF performs above or below the S&amp;P avg return or whatever index/ value I want to use?
